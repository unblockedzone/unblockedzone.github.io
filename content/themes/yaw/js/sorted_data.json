Determine the starting player, usually by drawing tiles and seeing who has the letter closest to \"A.\"</p><p>Gameplay:\n1. The starting player forms a word using their tiles and places it on the board, ensuring one tile is on the center square.\n2. Each player takes turns forming words by adding tiles to those already on the board.\n3. Words can be formed horizontally or vertically but must be valid according to the dictionary.\n4. Players draw new tiles from the bag after their turn to always have seven tiles.\n5. If a player cannot form a word, they may exchange tiles or pass their turn.</p><p>Scoring:\n1.

Special board squares can multiply letter or word scores (e.g., double letter score, triple word score).\n3. Track scores on a scorepad.</p><p>Endgame:\n1. The game ends when all tiles have been drawn and one player uses all their tiles, or when no more valid moves can be made.\n2. Subtract any remaining tile points from each player’s score.\n3. The player with the highest score wins.</p><p>FAQs:</p><p>Q: Can I form a word in any direction?\nA: Words can only be formed horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.</p><p>Q: What if I don't have any valid moves?\nA: You can either exchange some or all of your tiles or pass your turn.</p><p>Q: Can I add letters to an existing word?\nA: Yes, you can add letters to an existing word to form a new word, as long as it is valid.</p><p>Q: Are there any restrictions on the first word played?\nA: The first word must cover the center square of the board.</p><p>Q: How do I handle challenges to words?\nA: If a word is challenged, consult the dictionary. If the word is invalid, the player loses their turn.</p><p>Q: Can I use proper nouns or abbreviations?\nA: No, proper nouns and abbreviations are generally not allowed unless specified by house rules.</p><p>Q: What happens if the tile bag is empty?\nA: Continue playing until all tiles have been used or no more valid moves can be made.</p><p>Q: Can I skip my turn?\nA: Yes, you can choose to pass your turn if you cannot or do not wish to play a word.</p><p>Q: How do special board squares work?\nA: Special squares multiply the score of the letter or word placed on them. Use these strategically to maximize your points.</p><p>Q: What if two players have the same final score?\nA: In the case of a tie, the player with the highest-scoring word in a single turn usually wins. If still tied, consider it a draw or use house rules to break the tie.</p>",

If you roll an even number, your car moves back one space.\n   - Special spaces on the road may have instructions such as \"Move ahead 3 spaces\" or \"Lose a turn.\" Follow these instructions when you land on these spaces.\n5. <b>Winning the Game</b>: The last car remaining on the road after others have been bumped off wins the game.</p><p><b>FAQs:</b></p><p>1. <b>Q: How do I decide who goes first?</b>\n   A: Roll a die at the beginning. The player with the highest number goes first.</p><p>2. <b>Q: What happens if two cars land on the same space?</b>\n   A: The player who landed on the space must roll the die again. An odd number bumps the other car back one space; an even number moves your own car back one space.</p><p>3. <b>Q: What do I do if I land on a special space?</b>\n   A: Follow the instructions provided on that space, whether it’s moving forward, losing a turn, or any other action.</p><p>4. <b>Q: Can I bump off a car if I land on the same space as it?</b>\n   A: No car gets permanently bumped off the road. Instead, follow the bumping rules—odd/even roll—to determine movement.</p><p>5. <b>Q: How do I know when the game ends?</b>\n   A: The game ends when only one car is left on the road, and that car’s player is the winner.</p><p>6. <b>Q: Can I play this game with more than two players?</b>\n   A: Yes, the game can be played with multiple players. Simply ensure each player has a car and takes turns according to the rules.</p><p>7. <b>Q: What if I roll a number higher than the spaces remaining to the end of the road?</b>\n   A: You can only move up to the last space. If you cannot move the exact number rolled, stay in your place and pass the turn to the next player.</p><p>8. <b>Q: Is there a limit to how many turns I can lose?</b>\n   A: No, each \"lose a turn\" instruction stands as is, regardless of how many times it occurs.</p>",
